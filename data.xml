    <scenario>
        <title>The Hotmail HTTPS issue</title>
        <text>As of recent memory, middle east governments are paranoid than ever as activism became
            rampant in other countries after Egypt and the uprising in Libya. Afraid that the
            citizens of Syria may also turn against their government sooner or later, the Syrian
            government has decided to investigate on these claims first before controlling internet
            access. Besides crawling through multiple social groups in many popular social networks,
            the government also decided on investigating how e-mail exchanges are conducted per
            users. With the means to do so, the government can drop secure web protocols to allow
            them access to sift through people's data who they suspect to cause trouble, all in the
            name of keeping peace and order. After all, only a handful of individuals would be able
            to tell the difference, and data would be kept confidential and with care.

        <action>Microsoft decides to drop secure webmail (HTTPS) access temporarily so that the
            government can assure itself of harmful activism.

    <scenario>
        <title>Digital Rights Management and Books</title>
        <text>DRM is known for two ways: A security measure for publishers against piracy and a way
            to track legitimate purchases. As with DRM, piracy is lessened as it prevents others
            from copying digital content. However, consumers treat DRM-laced products like the
            plague and avoid such products because of its restrictive nature and lack of sharing. By
            using DRM, publishers are more assured that their sales are true and that people are
            actually paying money for their products. But by removing DRM, it adds convenience to
            buyers who want to share what they own the way they want to, and sometimes DRM leads to
            wider, positive feedback as it propagates to others without cost, at the expense of
            unpredictable sales numbers and possibly unwanted long-term effects.
